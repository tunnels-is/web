I want yout to create a new page for the "Personal VPN" section, you can find the link on the frontpage and currently it just links to /personal-vpn. 
NOTES:
 - documentation for this can be found here: ../tunnels-docs/content/docs/topics/single-server.mdx
 - Tunnels code can be found here: ../tunnels/server and ../tunnels/client 
 - Make a benefits/highlights page
 - Please create a decent variety of section styles, using modern designs in line with the current color theme. 
 - Current project is server @ localost:5173, you can use pupeteer to inspect and develop
 - This section is about setting up a personal VPN server using cloud services or your own hardware.
 - Please be creative with the section, feel free to break out of the current "box" like design mold and make something new.
