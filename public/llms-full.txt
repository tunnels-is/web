## Overview

Tunnels is a modern networking solution that connects users to multiple networks simultaneously with built-in security and privacy features. It is fully open source, written in Go, and designed to be portable — download, extract, and run with no installer required.

### Key Differentiators

- **Free self-hosting**: All features are available at no cost when self-hosted. No paywalls, no feature gates.
- **Multi-network VPN**: Connect to multiple VPN networks simultaneously with per-network DNS routing.
- **Built-in DNS security**: Integrated DNS server with daily updated block lists, custom DNS records, DNS-over-HTTPS translation, and DNS leak prevention — works without an account.
- **Portable**: No installation required. Download and run. Windows requires WinTUN driver for networking.
- **Open source**: Entire codebase is publicly auditable on GitHub. Security through transparency.
- **Post-quantum cryptography**: Uses ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-256-GCM, and AES-128-GCM encryption with X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange.
- **Zero trust architecture**: Every connection is authenticated. No implicit trust between components.
- **Scalable**: A single server handles up to 65,535 concurrent connections.

## Features

### VPN & Networking
- Connect to multiple VPN networks at once
- LAN over WAN — bridge isolated local networks across the internet
- NAT traversal for devices behind firewalls
- Advanced routing with per-network configuration
- TCP and UDP protocol support
- Server-managed routing and IP assignment

### DNS Security
- Built-in DNS server/proxy with extensive blacklisting
- Daily updated threat lists from trusted sources
- Custom A and TXT DNS records with wildcard support
- DNS routing across multiple connected networks
- DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) translation
- DNS leak prevention (works without a Tunnels account)
- Real-time DNS analytics and WHOIS lookup

### Security
- ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-256-GCM, AES-128-GCM encryption
- X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange (post-quantum resistant)
- Zero trust architecture — every connection authenticated
- No logging of user actions on the public VPN network
- No tracking of any kind on the public network
- Fully open source and auditable
- Minimal dependencies, no third-party services

### Privacy & Anonymity
- Accounts can be created using usernames or UUIDs
- Anonymous license keys for account top-ups
- No logging, no tracking on the public network
- Self-hosted deployments give complete data sovereignty

## Pricing

Self-hosting is completely free. The public VPN network requires a subscription:

- **1 Month**: $8/month

- **12 Months**: $4/month (50% savings)

All plans include:
- Public VPN network access
- Money-back guarantee

## Use Cases

### Personal VPN
Run your own VPN server instead of trusting a commercial provider. Typically faster than shared commercial VPNs because you're not sharing bandwidth. Deploy on a $5-10/month cloud server for full control.

### Homelab
Self-host your VPN and securely access your homelab from anywhere. Built-in DNS management and ad blocking. Straightforward setup on any Linux system.

### Enterprise & Office
Enterprise-grade VPN with centralized management, access controls, and multi-server deployment. Connect remote employees to office resources. Company-wide configurations can be distributed as simple files. 24/7 support for enterprise clients. On-premise deployment available. No vendor lock-in.

### Cloud & Baremetal
Deploy distributed VPN infrastructure with centralized authentication. Scale globally with multiple servers managed from a single control plane.

### IoT Networks
Secure IoT device fleet with encrypted remote access. Token-based device authentication for headless operation. CLI mode for resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pi, embedded Linux). Network segmentation with separate subnets and firewall rules. Bandwidth limits per device.

### LAN over WAN
Bridge isolated local networks across the internet. Create a unified network spanning multiple physical locations with end-to-end encryption.

### Public VPN
Create your own public VPN service. Route internet traffic through servers you control with full privacy and no third-party data access.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Do I need technical knowledge to set this up?**
Basic Linux command-line knowledge helps, but the guided setup process makes it straightforward. If you can SSH into a server and copy-paste commands, you can set up your VPN.

**Is this legal?**
Yes, running your own VPN server is completely legal in most countries. You're simply encrypting your own internet traffic through your own server.

**How many devices can connect simultaneously?**
A single server supports up to 65,535 concurrent connections (protocol limit). A basic $5/month server can handle 10-20 simultaneous connections for typical use.

**What happens if my server goes down?**
Your internet connection continues working normally — you just won't have VPN protection until the server is back up. Cloud providers typically have 99.9%+ uptime.

### Pricing

**What's the difference between plans?**
All plans provide the same features and access to the public VPN network. Longer subscriptions offer better value with discounted monthly rates.

**Can I create an account anonymously?**
Yes. Accounts can be created using usernames or UUIDs, and topped up using anonymous license keys purchased separately.

**Do you offer refunds?**
Yes, all subscriptions include a money-back guarantee.

**What payment methods do you accept?**
All major credit cards through a secure payment processor. Anonymous license keys can be purchased separately.

### IoT

**Do devices need a lot of resources to run the client?**
No. The Tunnels client has a CLI mode designed for resource-constrained devices. It runs efficiently on Raspberry Pi, embedded Linux systems, and other low-power hardware.

**Can I isolate IoT devices from my main network?**
Yes. Tunnels supports network segmentation with separate subnets and firewall rules.

**How do devices authenticate without user interaction?**
Devices use token-based authentication. Generate a device token from the admin interface, and the device authenticates automatically on startup.
