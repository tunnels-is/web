# Website building
I want you to review all textual content on the website against the logic in the VPN server and client and make sure the website is not saying things that are not true. We need to make sure all the content is accurate. Make a todolist for EVERY PAGE and review all the content in the ./src/content/siteContent.jsx

Also, if any text content is not inside the siteContent.jsx please move it there.


NOTES:
 - This project is a websit for the code located in "/home/sveinn/code/tunnels/server" and "/home/sveinn/code/tunnels/client"
 - Do not make any hyperbolic satements
 - Keep the content wording casual
 - VPN server(and controller/auth) code: "/home/sveinn/code/tunnels/server"
 - VPN client code: "/home/sveinn/code/tunnels/client"
 - UI code: "/home/sveinn/code/tunnels/frontend"
 - Documentation: "/home/sveinn/code/docs/content"
 - Website content:  "./src/content/siteContent.jsx"


Think super hard about this, take your time, there is no token or time limit.
superthink!
